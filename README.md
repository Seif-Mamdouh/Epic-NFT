# EPIC_NFT

**The Project’s Main Concept:**

The project’s main goal is to destroy the big dawg: the Boss. Let’s say the big guy has 1,000,000HP. What players do is when they start the game, they mint a character NFT that has a certain amount of Attack Damage and HP. Players can order their character NFT to attack and deal damage to it. It’s kinda like Pokemon.

**The main goal?💪 **

The main goal is players need to work together in order to bring the boss’s HP down to 0. 

**However, life isn’t that easy. There’s a catch🤞🏼:**
	
When a player hits the BigDawg, the player is also wounded. And the players are the ones that suffer the most. Assume the BigDawg has 100,000 HP and the local player has 1,000HP. Each hit is worth 500HP. The player is then half-way through dying. If the NFT's HP goes below 0, the player's NFT dies and they can't hit the boss anymore. Players can only have one character NFT in their wallet. Once the character's NFT dies, it's game over. That means many players need to join forces to attack the boss and kill it.

The important thing to know here is that the characters themselves are NFTs.
So, when a player goes to play the game:
1) They'll connect their wallet.
2) Our game will detect they don't have a character NFT in their wallet.
3) I let them choose a character and mint their own character NFT to play the game. Each character NFT has its own attributes stored on the NFT directly like: HP, Attack Damage, the image of the character, etc. So, when the character's HP hits 0, it would say hp: 0 on the NFT itself.

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
