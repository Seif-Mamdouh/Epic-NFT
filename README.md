# EPIC_NFT

The Project’s Main Concept:

The projet’s main goal is to destroy the big dawg: the Boss. Let’s say the big guy has 1,000,000HP. What players do is when they start the game, they mint a character NFT that has a certain amount of Attack Damage and HP. Players can order their character NFT to attack and deal damage to it. It’s kinda like Pokemon.

The main goal?💪 

The main goal is players need to work together in order to bring the boss’s HP down to 0. 

However, life isn’t that easy. There’s a catch🤞🏼:
	
When a player hits the BigDawg, the player is also wounded. And the players are the ones that suffer the most. Assume the BigDawg has 100,000 HP and the local player has 1,000HP. Each hit is worth 500HP. The player is then half-way through dying. If the NFT's HP goes below 0, the player's NFT dies and they can't hit the boss anymore. Players can only have one character NFT in their wallet. Once the character's NFT dies, it's game over. That means many players need to join forces to attack the boss and kill it.

The Bigger Picture is, 
Start will write a smart contract. That contract has all the logic around our actual game.
My smart contract will be deployed to the local blockchain. This means anyone can access my smart contract and run my game. ( I’m giving access. I know I’m a nice guy 🙄  ).
Building the client website. The website will help people easily connect their Ethereum Wallet and play our game.


The important thing to know here is that the characters themselves are NFTs.
So, when a player goes to play the game:
1) They'll connect their wallet.
2) Our game will detect they don't have a character NFT in their wallet.
3) I let them choose a character and mint their own character NFT to play the game. Each character NFT has its own attributes stored on the NFT directly like: HP, Attack Damage, the image of the character, etc. So, when the character's HP hits 0, it would say hp: 0 on the NFT itself.
